# 🎨 Visual Guide for Nano Banana Pro - Mon Petit Poulailler

## 1. Stylistic Objective
The goal is to produce "children's book" style illustrations that exude a warm, reassuring, and handcrafted atmosphere. Every image must look handmade on physical media (non-digital).

---

## 2. The "Artist Grain" Protocol
To avoid a "smooth" digital look, every prompt must include these technical specifications:
* **Support:** Thick and visible watercolor paper grain texture.
* **Mediums:** A blend of soft watercolor washes and colored pencil hatching.
* **Outlines:** Fine, delicate, and slightly irregular lines (pencil-drawn look).
* **Keywords:** Use "Hand-drawn aesthetic", "Visible pencil strokes", "Watercolor grain".

---

## 3a. Family Identity (Character Consistency)
Characters must be strictly based on `Ref-Personnages-Famille.png` for physical traits and relative heights:
* **Martin (The Father):** Benevolent silhouette, well-groomed full beard, kind eyes.
* **Julie (The Mother):** Wavy hair, welcoming smile, protective posture.
* **Anna (The Daughter):** Characteristic twin pigtails, joyful expression.
* **Lucas (The Son):** Short hair, often curious and interacting with animals.

## 3b. Pets (Visual Consistency)
Pets must follow the "cute & whimsical" style established in `animaux03.jpg`:
* **Barnabé (The Dog):** A cute 4-5 month old **Border Collie Sable**. Proportions include a slightly larger head, floppy ears, and rounded paws. Cream-colored coat with soft ginger/golden spots.
* **Pistache (The Cat):** A ginger tabby **Maine Coon** resembling a big round cloud of fur. Extreme fluffiness with a prominent ruff and a giant soft plume tail.
* **Note:** Characters and animals must always appear friendly and in harmony.

---

## 4. Seasonal Adaptation
Characters maintain their physical traits but adapt their wardrobe:
* **Winter:** Thick wool coats, knitted beanies, voluminous scarves, and snow boots.
* **Summer/Spring:** Denim overalls, light shirts, straw hats, or light dresses.

---

## 5. Color Palette and Light
* **Dominants:** Systematic use of warm pastels (Cream, Sunny Yellow, Sky Blue).
* **Light:** Favor soft lighting or the warm glow from chicken coop windows.
* **Atmosphere:** Always "airy and uncluttered" to ensure pedagogical clarity.

---

## 6. Negative Constraints (Strictly Prohibited)
* **No 3D or CGI rendering**.
* **No plastic or overly smooth textures**.
* **No perfect digital gradients**.
* **No over-saturated or neon colors**.
