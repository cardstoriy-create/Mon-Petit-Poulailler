## 2. The "Artist Grain" Protocol
To avoid a "smooth" digital look, every prompt must follow the aesthetic of **Reference-Style.png** and include:
* **Support:** Thick and visible watercolor paper grain texture.
* **Mediums:** A blend of soft watercolor washes and colored pencil hatching.
* **Outlines:** Fine, delicate, and slightly irregular lines (pencil-drawn look).
* **Keywords:** "Hand-drawn aesthetic", "Visible pencil strokes", "Watercolor grain".
